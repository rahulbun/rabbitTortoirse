    <p>
        One day a rabbit was boasting about how fast he could run. He was laughing at the turtle for<br>
        being so slow. Much to the rabbitâ€™s surprise, the turtle challenged him to a race. The rabbit<br>
        thought this was a good joke and accepted the challenge. The fox was to be the umpire of the<br>
        race. As the race began, the rabbit raced way ahead of the turtle, just like everyone thought.<br>
        <br>
        The rabbit got to the halfway point and could not see the turtle anywhere. He was hot and<br>
        tired and decided to stop and take a short nap. Even if the turtle passed him, he would be able<br>
        to race to the finish line ahead of him. All this time the turtle kept walking step by step by step.<br>
        He never quit no matter how hot or tired he got. He just kept going.<br>
        <br>
        However, the rabbit slept longer than he had thought and woke up. He could not see the turtle<br>
        anywhere! He went at full speed to the finish line but found the turtle there waiting for him.<br>
